##Image Encryption using Chaos theory

######This project deals with the encryption and decryption of the image using a logistic equation 

######which is iterated in a loop at a certain number of times to genearte random value.The generated 

######random value is used in key generation where it is further used in operations like XORing with 

######the pixels.

######Allowed image formats are .jpeg and .png . User can can select any of the mentioned image formats 

######file to do the operation.User can use their own key to encrypt and decrypt the image 

######file.Encryption and decryption of the image depends on the size and resolution of the image.

######This project also does the analysis of the images between encrypted and the original image.This 

######is done on the basis of the distribution of red, blue and green pixels.
