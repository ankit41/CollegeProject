## Image Encryption using Chaos theory

###### This project deals with the encryption and decryption of the image using two logistic equation 

###### which is iterated in a loop at a certain number of times to genearte distinct value.The generated 

###### distinct value is used in key generation where it is further used in operations like XORing with 

###### the pixels.

###### A separate Image analyzer tool is provided to do various kinds of analysis on the image.
###### Analysis like NPCR,UACI,Correlation coefficient ,RMSE ,Histogram are integrated in this
###### software .

### Prerequisites
###### If you want to modify the code then you need to install any IDE for python like PyCharm
###### This codes works on both python 2.7 and 3.2 version

### Installing
###### Copy this project folder into your project workspace.Open the GUI.py file in the IDE
###### You will get some errors as many libraries will be unavailable.Libraries required to
###### run this code are matplotlib, pillow, numbpy, histogram, tkinter

### Built With
###### PycharmIDE
###### Flask Framework
###### Tkinter library

###### Allowed image formats are .jpeg and .png . User can can select any of the mentioned image formats 

###### file to do the operation.User can use their own key to encrypt and decrypt the image 

###### file.Encryption and decryption of the image depends on the size and resolution of the image.

###### This project also does the analysis of the images between encrypted and the original image.This 

###### is done on the basis of the distribution of red, blue and green pixels.
